## About Me 
I am Sean McLeish, a third year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Maryland advised by [Tom Goldstein](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/). I graduated from the University of Warwick in 2023 with a first class BSc (Hons) in Discrete Mathematics. My research currently focuses on algorithmic reasoning and language modelling.
