title: "[Re] End-to-end Algorithm Synthesis with Recurrent Networks: Logical Extrapolation Without Overthinking"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'In this report, we aim to validate the claims of Bansal et al. These are that the recurrent architecture presented, with skip connections and a progressive loss function, prevent the original problem being forgotten or corrupted during processing allowing for the recurrent module to be applied indefinitely and that this architecture avoids the overthinking trap. We use both code released by the authors and newly developed to recreate many results presented in the paper. Additionally, we present analysis of the newly introduced alpha hyperparameter and investigate interesting perturbation behaviour of prefix sums models. Further, we conduct a hyperparameter search and provide an analysis of the Asymptotic Alignment scores of the models presented.'
